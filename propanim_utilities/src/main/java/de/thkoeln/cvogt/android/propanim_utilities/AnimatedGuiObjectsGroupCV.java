/**
 * Class for groups of objects of class AnimatedGuiObjectCV that can be animated together.
 * <BR><BR>
 * Note: Playing multiple animators for an object group sequentially might lead to unexpected results.
 * For example, expanding a group by a scaling factor f and then contracting it by the factor 1/f will NOT return to the original
 * placement of the objects but will finally result in a contraction of the original group by the factor 1/f.
 * The reason for this behavior is that an animator is based on the state of the group at the time of the definition of this animator
 * rather than on the group state at its starting time.
 * It is therefore recommended to define only animators that are started simultaneously at once
 * and to define other animators that shall start later not before that first set of animators has finished playing.
 * This could be done by a separate thread that sleeps while the first set of animators is playing.
